    <h1>Privacy Policy for Perfecttodo TreeGrid Jira Cloud App</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Perfecttodo TreeGrid is a client-side Jira Cloud application built on Atlassian’s Forge platform. It enables users to input data in a grid or list layout via double-click and organize it using a tree structure for hierarchical visualization and management, with export support for XML, JSON, CSV, and TXT formats only. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency in how we handle your data. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding your information.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
        <h3>2.1 No Personal Data Collection</h3>
        <p>Perfecttodo TreeGrid operates entirely client-side in your browser and does not collect, store, or process personal data on external servers. All data, including grids, lists, and tree structures, is stored within your Atlassian Jira Cloud instance, subject to Atlassian’s privacy and security practices.</p>

        <h3>2.2 User-Generated Content</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Grid and List Data</strong>: Any data you enter into Perfecttodo TreeGrid (e.g., text in grid cells, tree node labels) is processed locally in your browser and saved as attachments or data within your Jira Cloud instance. We do not access, collect, or store this data.</li>
            <li><strong>Export Files</strong>: When you export data in XML, JSON, CSV, or TXT formats, the files are generated locally in your browser and either saved to Jira Cloud or downloaded to your device. No export data is transmitted to or stored by Perfecttodo TreeGrid.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.3 Third-Party Integrations</h3>
        <p>If you choose to integrate Perfecttodo TreeGrid with external cloud storage (e.g., Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive) for importing or exporting data, you explicitly authorize access to those services. We do not collect or store any data from these integrations; all data remains under your control and is subject to the privacy policies of the respective third-party providers.</p>

        <h3>2.4 No Metadata or Usage Tracking</h3>
        <p>Perfecttodo TreeGrid does not collect metadata (e.g., IP addresses, browser information) or track user activity (e.g., grid edits, tree navigation) outside of Atlassian’s infrastructure. No server-side logging occurs, as the app has no external servers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>
        <p>Since Perfecttodo TreeGrid does not collect or store any personal data or user-generated content, we do not use your data for any purpose. All data processing occurs locally in your browser or within Jira Cloud, under Atlassian’s privacy practices.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>4. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No Data Sharing</strong>: Perfecttodo TreeGrid does not share, sell, or disclose any data to third parties, as no data is collected or stored by the app.</li>
            <li><strong>Atlassian Infrastructure</strong>: Data stored in Jira Cloud is subject to Atlassian’s Privacy Policy, available at <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/legal/privacy-policy">Atlassian’s Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Obligations</strong>: In the unlikely event we are required by law to disclose data, we will notify affected users to the extent permitted, unless prohibited by law. Since no data is stored by Perfecttodo TreeGrid, such scenarios are highly improbable.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
        <p>Perfecttodo TreeGrid is designed with privacy and security in mind:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Client-Side Processing</strong>: All data entry, tree organization, and exports are processed locally in your browser, ensuring no data leaves your device except to Jira Cloud.</li>
            <li><strong>Encryption</strong>: Data stored in Jira Cloud is protected by Atlassian’s AES-256 encryption at rest and encrypted in transit using TLS 1.2+ with Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS).</li>
            <li><strong>Zero Egress Architecture</strong>: Built on Atlassian’s Forge platform, Perfecttodo TreeGrid ensures no data is transmitted to external servers.</li>
            <li><strong>Browser Security</strong>: The app leverages modern browser security features (e.g., Content Security Policy, Same-Origin Policy) to protect against unauthorized access.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For more details, refer to our Security Policy, available upon request by contacting <a href="mailto:perfecttodo@outlook.com">perfecttodo@outlook.com</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>6. Your Privacy Rights</h2>
        <p>As Perfecttodo TreeGrid does not collect personal data, most privacy rights (e.g., access, deletion, portability) apply to data stored in Jira Cloud, managed by Atlassian. You may:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access or Delete Data</strong>: Manage your grid, list, and tree data directly within Jira Cloud, subject to your Jira permissions.</li>
            <li><strong>Third-Party Integrations</strong>: Revoke access to cloud storage services (e.g., Google Drive, OneDrive) via those platforms’ settings.</li>
            <li><strong>Contact Us</strong>: For privacy-related inquiries or to request a Data Processing Agreement (DPA), email <a href="mailto:perfecttodo@outlook.com">perfecttodo@outlook.com</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you are in a region with specific privacy laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA), your rights are supported through Atlassian’s infrastructure and our minimal data approach.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>7. Compliance with Privacy Laws</h2>
        <p>Perfecttodo TreeGrid supports compliance with privacy regulations, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</strong>: By not collecting personal data and processing all data client-side, we minimize privacy risks.</li>
            <li><strong>California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</strong>: We do not sell or share personal information, and no data is collected for commercial purposes.</li>
            <li><strong>Atlassian’s Compliance</strong>: Data stored in Jira Cloud benefits from Atlassian’s compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and other global privacy standards.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>Perfecttodo TreeGrid is not intended for use by individuals under 16 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe a child has used the app, please contact us at <a href="mailto:perfecttodo@outlook.com">perfecttodo@outlook.com</a>, and we will assist in addressing the issue through Jira Cloud’s data management tools.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
